# burger

### Overview

In this assignment, I created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. I've followed the MVC design pattern; used Node and MySQL to query and route data in my app, and Handlebars to generate my HTML.

### To Use

* This app will let you create new food items and then consume them. 

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
